STUDY SUMMARY</p>\n                <p>Skin sensitization study was performed to evaluate the sensitization following application of test item extracts of “XXXX” using rabbits Maximization Test Method as per Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 10: Tests for Skin Sensitization, ISO 10993-10: 2021. This study also provides rational basis of risk assessment in humans.</p>\n                <p>Thirty three animals were acclimatized and thirty were grouped into four groups, G1a-Polar Vehicle Control, G2a-Polar Test Item Extract, G1b-Non-polar Vehicle Control and G2b-Non-polar Test Item Extract.</p>\n                <p>Fur of all animals was closely clipped about 24 hrs prior to induction phase (induction and topical application) and challenge application phase. In both the case, care was taken to avoid abrasion on the skin.</p>\n                <p>On Day 1 intradermal induction phase with one each part of FCA and extract was used for intradermal administration. The animals from G1a and G1b, polar and non-polar Vehicle control for respective group whereas test groups G2a and G2b were injected with polar and non-polar test item extracts. The animals were injected at the shoulder region with 0.1 mL per injection of 3 pairs of intradermal injections. Injections 1 and 2 were given near the head region at least 1 cm apart and injection 3 was given 2 cm apart towards caudal part of the body. On Day 2 (24 hrs post intradermal administration) and Day 3 (48 hrs post intradermal administration) skin reactions for erythema and oedema were scored and recorded as per Draize method. Skin Irritation was observed (erythema/oedema) at this phase and hence SDS was not applied.</p>\n                <p>Topical induction was carried out on Day 8 using patches of filter paper (2 cm x 4 cm) loaded with 0.5 mL of respective Vehicle control and test item extracts were applied over the dorsal clipped region of the animals and secured with semi occlusive dressing by hypoallergic tape for 48 hrs. On Day 10 (1-hr post patch removal) and Day 11 (24 hrs post patch removal) skin reactions for erythema and oedema were scored as per Draize method.</p>\n                <p>Challenge exposure was carried out on Day 22 i.e., after 14 Days completion of the topical induction phase, Patches of filter paper (2 cm x 4 cm) loaded with 0.5 mL of Polar vehicle control and Polar test item extracts were applied to the anterior right flank and Anterior Left Flank of G1a and G2a group animals. Similarly, Patches of filter paper (2 cm x 4 cm) loaded with 0.5 mL of Non-Polar vehicle control and Non-Polar test item extracts were applied to the anterior right flank and anterior Left Flank of G1b and G2b group animals. Patches were held in contact for 24 hrs with semi occlusive dressing by hypoallergic tape. The Re-challenge phase was not performed as there were no skin reactions during Challenge exposure phase.</p>\n                <p>All animals were observed for skin reactions (erythema) at 24h and 48h post removal of the dressings in the challenge phase. The skin reactions were scored as per Magnusson and Kligman grading scale.</p>\n                <p>All the animals of were observed once daily for clinical signs and twice daily for mortality and morbidity till the end of observation period (Day 25). Body weights were measured on Day of acclimatization, day 1 and at the end of the observation period (Day 25). All the animals of were observed for skin reaction on day 2 (24h), 3 (48hr) after the intradermal administration, day 10 (1hr), 11 (24hr) post removal of dressing after induction (topical application) and day 24 (24hr), 25 (48hr) after removal of dressing in the challenge.</p>\n                <p><b>Summary of Study Results:</b> No clinical signs and mortality/morbidity were observed. On Day 2 (24 hrs) none of the animals elicits any erythema/oedema and Day 3 (48 hrs) post intradermal injections, some elicits very slightly erythema and all the animals of vehicle control and test item extracts groups elicits very slight oedema this owing to FCA in the extracts and conforms the hyperreactive skin prior to topical and challenge phase. On Day 10 and Day 11 Post topical application, all the animals of vehicle control and test item extracts group revealed no erythema/oedema. In challenge phase, all animals of vehicle control and test item extracts group revealed no erythema. The body weights were unaffected by test item extracts.</p>\n                <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Based on the above results, the graded (Magnusson and Kligman grading scale) score was 0. The comparison of the skin reaction (at the challenge phase) of the test item treated animals with those of the vehicle control group animals show that the test item “XXXX” is classified as “Non-sensitizer” to rabbits under the stated experimental condition.</p>\n              </div>\n            </section>\n\n            <section id=\"sec11\" class=\"mt-0 pl-5 pr-5 pt-3 pb-3\">\n              <div class=\"col-12\">\n                <p class=\"font-weight-bold\">11.
